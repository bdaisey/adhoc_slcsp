Script to populate slcsp costs is found in 'slcsp.py'

Script requires 3 given .csv files in the same directory:
- slcsp.csv
- plans.csv
- zips.csv

If all 3 csv files are present, then no arguments are necessary for the script,
simply run by calling 'python slcsp.py' or 'python3 slcsp.py', depending on local
python environment setup.  No python packages are needed to run the script besides
built-in modules (although some of the files in 'supplemental' folder require
jupyter and pandas).
